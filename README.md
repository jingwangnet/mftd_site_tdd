# Refactory mfdw_site with TDD

**mfdw_site project**  is from the book of **Build a website with Django 3**, The
book is awesome for beginner. It's low curves to learn the Django concepts.
It's not mean the book is perfect right now. The book has some code what is outdate
coz of  the writer of the book wrote by Django 3. and another code is bad logic. So I want to refactory
the code for learning the Django. 

## Test the original code of the  book 

Source code

```bash
git clone -b book https://github.com/jingwangnet/mftd_site_tdd.git 
```

Deploy code by Docker 

```bash
docker push jingwangnet/mfdw-site:book 
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 jingwangnet/mfdw-site:book
```
